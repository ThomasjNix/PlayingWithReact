<h1>ReactJS, because why not?</h1>

<p>I thought it would be good to explore outside of Angular, so React was a natural choice. Currently I am using an online REPL to run my JSX as I follow an online React course, so until I decide to move to a local environment (or until I am forced to by file structure, rather...), I will only be posting the script I run there.</p>
